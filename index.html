								<p>Hi, I'm Jacob Duncan, a computer science student at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario. I'm a gamer at heart and have been playing games since I could speak. Over the past four years, I've been focusing on developing my coding skills and creating games that challenge and engage players.</p>							
								<p>In 2022, I successfully released my first multiplayer game on Steam, which was an incredible accomplishment. I sold over 450 copies and im already working on more projects and excited to see where my journey as a game developer takes me. My second game is planned to be released before the end of April, 2023.</p>
								<p>I'm known for my strong work ethic, discipline, and loyalty. These qualities have helped me become the developer I am today. I'm always on the lookout for new and innovative ways to create games that players will enjoy, and I know that there's always room for improvement.</p>
								<p>I'm incredibly passionate about game development, and I'm eager to continue pushing myself to reach new heights. I'm confident that with my dedication, hard work, and enthusiasm, I will be an asset to your team.</p>

								<p>In this portfolio, I'm excited to showcase my journey in game development. I first started dabbling in game development back in 2015, but it wasn't until 2021 that I began to make significant progress in my skills. Throughout the years, I've learned that game development is a constant process of learning and improving, and I'm proud of the progress I've made so far. In this portfolio, you'll find a collection of my work that demonstrates my growth and dedication to the craft All work below is done solely bymyself unless otherwise stated. </p>

								<p>The first game I ever released and created a full game loop on was a multiplayer game made using UE5. This was the first game I ever made and it took me about two months. Its important to note this is when I truly started game dev and my skills have drastically improved since this titles release. I sold over 450 copies and learned alot developing this project. The game features proximity voice chat, an AI that actively considers all players to make its decisions, and a full game loop. One of the major challenges of this project was networking between server and client, and I gained a deep understanding of peer-to-peer networking and the Steam API, which allows clients to play without having to port forward. I've included a screenshot of the game and photos of the UI and trailer below for you to check out.</p>

									<p>Below are two pictures the layout for hosting and joining servers. Surprisingly for me creating a server browser and hosting servers was possibly the most difficult part of this project. When making the mutliplayer server logic I had to connect it to the Steam API and ensure you could leave them, only see them when there not full or not started, and all other necessary multiplayer logic for a fully released game.</p>

									  <p>I also have a game project that was made using Godot and completed in less than 24 hours for a school project. Despite the short timeframe, the game includes a full game loop and features unique gameplay mechanics. In the game, players must deliver packages for five days while facing different events that add an extra level of challenge. These events include being chased by a dog or encountering a customer who goes mad and tries to kill the player. On the fifth day, the player must escape on a jet to complete the game. Despite the short development time, this project exceeded the expectations for a first-year game development course at university. I've included four pictures of the game below for you to check out.</p>

									  <p>Recently, I've been working on a space game made in Unity HDRP. The game is heavily reliant on physics, with almost every object being a rigid body of some sort. To achieve the desired effect of separate compartments that could be hit by objects and react, I had to come up with a creative solution. I wanted normal gravity within the spaceship, but no gravity applied to the spaceship itself. Initially, I tried to change the gravity vector every frame to the direction of the ground on the spaceship when inside. However, despite my code being correct, I realized that this was too complicated for the physics engine. So, I simulated normal gravity somewhere else when inside the ship and transformed it to the child of the spaceship. Now, you can float and walk on the spaceship even if it is spinning extremely fast, such as when it gets hit by a meteor. The game also features impressive graphics thanks to Unity's High Definition Render Pipeline, and I aim to release it before the end of April. Below, you'll find more images of the game for you to check out.</p>

									  <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin: 20px;">
										<img src="images/1.png" style="width: 50%; margin-right: 20px;">

									  </div>
									  



									  <p><img src="images/7.png" style="width: 100%;"</p>
									  <p>I want to highlight that every aspect of the space game project was done by myself, including the coding, design, and asset creation. For the models in the game, I quickly created them in Blender, and they are currently just placeholders. With this project, I am excited to showcase the potential of Unity's High Definition Render Pipeline and push the boundaries of what is possible with physics in a game. I look forward to releasing the game soon and sharing it with the gaming community. Below are more images of the game for you to check out. You can also see a rough model for what the spaceship will look like at whole and I intend for each visible compartment to seperate.</p>

							<p>In summary, the games showcased in this portfolio are a testament to my passion and dedication to game development. These projects, spanning across multiple game engines and platforms, demonstrate my ability to create immersive game experiences, from the simple to the complex. I want to emphasize that every aspect of these games, including the coding, design, and asset creation, was done entirely by myself. This portfolio is an ongoing project that I update regularly, as I continue to explore and push the boundaries of what is possible in game development. I am excited about the future of this industry and the potential for creativity and innovation, and I am eager to continue creating amazing game experiences that captivate and entertain players. Thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with you soon.</p>

								<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="images/nicolday.jpeg" alt="" /></span> -->

									
									<p>My name is Jacob Duncan, a 1st year computer science student at Carleton University with a passion for game development. When I'm not coding, you can find me scuba diving, gaming, or hanging out with friends.</p>
									<p>I grew up in the north of Toronto, Canada, I come from a family of 4 including myself. Half my family is from Germany including my mother so I can speak English and German, although my profesional vocabulary is limited in German. I have worked in various industries, including at a marina, in marine construction, and at a grocery store. Recently upon going into computer science and even before school working on all things code, my love for coffee has remained strongest.</p>
									<p>My game development journey started as a solo experience, which has given me a comprehensive understanding of all parts of the game development process. Although I excel in writing game and networking logic, I've also gained extensive experience in animation logic, creating assets, and importing them into projects.</p>
									<p>Through working on solo games, I've come to appreciate the importance of teamwork in creating the best games. I understand how only the best games can be created by working together and that each team member plays a vital role in the development process. </p>
									<p>Overall, I'm excited about the future of game development and am committed to pursuing this passion with dedication and hard work. Whether I'm working on solo projects or collaborating with others, I strive to create games that are both engaging and entertaining for player. I hope to join a team that shares my vision and values and work together to create something truly great.</p>
